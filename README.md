Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project



Project Overview

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a movie dataset to uncover patterns, extract insights, and prepare the data for further analysis or modeling. The focus is on cleaning, visualizing, and understanding the data.

Key Features

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.

Data Transformation: Parsing, formatting, and encoding features.

Data Visualization: Generating plots and charts to explore relationships and distributions.

Insights Extraction: Summarizing findings and identifying trends.



Dataset

Source: Kaggle

Description: This dataset contains metadata about movies, including genres, cast, crew roles, keywords, profit, and popularity.

File(s):

movies_df

ratings_df

credits_df

keywords_df




Tools and Libraries

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis

NumPy: Numerical computations

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization

Scikit-learn: Data preprocessing

Ast: Parsing JSON-like strings

Key Steps

1. Data Cleaning

Converted data types for consistency.

Parsed JSON-like columns (genres, cast, crew, keywords).

Handled missing and duplicate values.

2. Data Transformation

Extracted meaningful fields from nested structures.

Created new features for analysis.

3. Data Visualization

Visualized distributions, correlations, and trends using:

Histograms

Scatter plots

Box plots

Heatmaps

4. Insights

Identified key patterns and trends.

Highlighted outliers and anomalies.



Results

Cleaned dataset ready for modeling.

Visualizations highlighting key trends.

Summary of actionable insights.
